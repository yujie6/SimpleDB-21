#  Design Decisions
* I use `ArrayList.iterator()` to generate `HeapPage`'s iterator.
* Use `HashMap` to store buffered pages.

# How long I spent
I spent about 8 hours, and I used half of the time debugging the last test.
One confusing part is the usage of `readNBytes` in java, the offset is not about the file's offset
but the target's offset. And we should use `skip()` to adjust file's offset, it took me quite some time
to find out.

Another confusing part is the `AbastractDbFileIterator.java`, actually I didn't use it.
