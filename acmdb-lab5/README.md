## How long I spent
I spent about 2 days (3 hours per day), and 
found the debugging progress quite annoying, since
the test cases are complex and not straight forward.
I cannot get any useful information from a 
simple `Assertion Error`. Which results that I have
to print all information and check them one by one.
