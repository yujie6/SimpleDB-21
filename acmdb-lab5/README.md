## Design Decisions
* Lock.java:  a data structure that 
keep tracks of tid & pid related to a lock.
* LockManager.java: a collection of methods that
maintain the states of all exclusive and shared locks.
* How to avoid dead lock: use wait-time-out method


## API Changes
Nope

## Missing or Incomplete Elements
Nope

## How long I spent
I spent about 3 days (3 hours per day), and 
found the debugging progress quite annoying, since
the test cases are complex and not straight forward.
I cannot get any useful information from a 
simple `Assertion Error`. Which results that I have
to print all information and check them one by one.
