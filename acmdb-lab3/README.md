# Lab 3 Document
## Design Decisions
* Join: just use nested loops
* Aggregator: just store the needed tuples in an array,
and then compute the result
* Insert/Delete: quite direct implementation

## API Changes
Nope

## Missing or Incomplete Elements
Nope

## How long I spent
I spent about 2 days (3 hours per day), and there aren't anything confusing, I found it quite clear after reading the docs
